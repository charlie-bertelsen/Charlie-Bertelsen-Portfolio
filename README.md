# 📖 About Me

My name is Charlie Bertelsen and I am currently a Data Analytics major at Washington State University. I enjoy working with data to find patterns, solve problems, and tell stories through interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Some of my favorite projects include analyzing airline auxiliary revenue, exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on traffic patterns in Los Angeles, and building a personal fitness tracker to store health data and track progress toward my goals. You can find some of these projects below!

I'm currently focused on growing my skills in advanced SQL, data engineering, and storytelling through dashboards with Microsoft Power BI.

Outside of data, I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to turn ideas into impactful projects.
