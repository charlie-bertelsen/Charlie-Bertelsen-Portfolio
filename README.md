# 📖 About Me
Hey, I'm Charlie Bertelsen — a Data Analytics major at Washington State University. I enjoy working with data to find patterns, solve problems, and build interactive dashboards and visualizations.

I'm experienced with Python, SQL, and R, and love using tools like Pandas, ggplot2, and Shiny to turn complex data into clear, meaningful insights. Some of my favorite projects include analyzing airline auxiliary revenue, exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on traffic patterns in Los Angeles, and building a personal fitness tracker to store health data and track progress toward my goals.

I'm currently focused on growing my skills in advanced SQL, data engineering, and storytelling through dashboards with Microsoft Power BI.

Outside of data, I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to turn ideas into impactful projects.
